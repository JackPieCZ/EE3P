## Data Structure: üóÉ

The data is organized into folders, each representing a specific experiment from the paper. Each folder contains the following files:

- `.raw`: Raw event camera data in the [EVT  3.0](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/data/encoding_formats/evt3.html#chapter-data-encoding-formats-evt3) format.
- `_slowdownfactor_fps.avi`: Slowed down video of the event stream.
- `_tachometer_data.xml`: Ground truth data from the laser tachometer (if applicable).

### Folder Descriptions: üìÅ

- `01_line`: Experiment measuring the rotational speed of a disc with a high-contrast mark.
- `02_velcro`: Experiment measuring the rotational speed of a disc with a uniform velcro surface.
- `03_velcroside`: Experiment measuring the rotational speed of a disc with velcro, viewed from the side.
- `04_speaker`: Experiment measuring the vibration frequency of a speaker diaphragm.
- `05_led`: Experiment measuring the flashing frequency of an LED.

**Note:** 
Not all experiments use the laser tachometer, hence the absence of the corresponding data file in some folders.

## Usage: üöÄ

The data can be used for various purposes, including:
- Reproducing the experiments in the paper.
- Developing and testing new methods for frequency and rotational speed estimation using event cameras.
- Comparing the performance of different event camera-based methods.
